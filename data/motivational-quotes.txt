Everything is theretically impossible until it is done;If a cluttered desk is a sign of a cluttered mind, of what, then, is an empty desk a sign?;Our virtues and our failures are inseparable, like force and matter. When they separate, man is no more;Impossible only means that you havenâ€™t found the solution yet;Every brilliant experiment, like every great work of art, starts with an act of imagination;Above all, don't fear difficult moments. The best comes from them;If you want to have good ideas, you must have many ideas;Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less;We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special;We cannot solve problems with the same thinking we used to create them;Common sense is the less common of the senses;
